# Quiz Engine

## Overview:
* The quiz engine will inspire and allow students to learn and stay afresh with their studies over the summer months. A sense of accomplishment and desire to learn encouraged me to take and complete this course.  I would like to instill that same pursuit of knowledge into my younger relatives and see them grow to their potential.  

## Live Prototype:

## Use Case:

* the purpose of the quiz engine was two fold:
	* inspired by my younger cousins, I wanted to create an application to encourage them to learn
	* produce a showcase react application which can be utilized as a portfolio piece in order to solicit job offers from a dev team which works on a similar product

## Initial UX:

## Functionality:

## Development Story:
* Prioritized User Stories:
	- distribute quiz to users
	- select quiz
	- poll with questions
	- questions with answers
	- navigation throughout quiz’s questions
	- storage of answers after each question
	- breadcrumbs throughout quiz’s questions (counter)
	- login
	- registration
	- data visualization
	- retake quiz

## Technical:
* web technologies utilized:
	- React
	- Redux
	- Node.js
	- Express
	- MongoDb, Mongoose, Robomongo
	- Yarn/ NPM
	- Enzyme, Chai, Mocha

## Lessons Learned:
	- Deployment:
		- a full stack applicaiton requires the deployment of both a server to support the node.js/ server side development, as well as a server to host the client/ web view
		- While CreateReactApp's black box of scripts does not easily support the support of synchronous servers for full stack development, a couple of options were pursued.  
		- my options/ attempted options included a Thinkful approach to React Starter Apps, the concurrently plugin and a json server


## Development Roadmap:
	- utilizing a KanBan Board, the development was broken into phases
	- working through the burn chart, I was able to break the project into bite size chunks
	- working from the server side development through to the client-side, features were implemented based on priority

## Vision:
